This repository contains the GEANT4 applications built, experimental data, and jupyter notebooks employed for the data analysis

Cal-Exp-Data folder has the data for detector calibration.
G4-Only-Det folder has the GEANT4 application just for one detector without the RPT system.
G4-RPT folder has the GEANT4 application with detector and macrocommands to move it.
RPT-Exp-data folder has experimental data acquired.
RPT-macros folder has the macrofiles generated for GEANT4 simulations.
RPT-sim-data folder has the results from the GEANT4 simulation.
RPT-dt.ipynb is the data analysis for the RPT.
RPT-zip-results.ipynb is the data analysis to zip the simulated results.
calib_dt.ipynb is the data analysis for the calibration detector.
utils.py y utils2.py are functions and classes to modularize the juoyter notebooks.
